# Description
I like computers

# Current interests
- Data storage
- Blockchain
- Developing on UNIX-like platforms (process management, signals, IPC, ...)
- String operations (pattern matching, tokenization, parsing)
- x86 assembly language
- Computer architecture

# Setup
- Arch refugee currently running Debian 12 on an AMD64 system because I don't like gigabytes of updates every week. I'd be using Slackware if it supported UEFI better.
- i3 (things seem to work well with it)
- `bash` shell with `vi` keybinds and GNU coreutils
- `neovim` and occasionally `emacs` (with `vi` keybinds) for anything that requires an IDE.

# Blog
- I have a [github.io blog](datemasamune2000.github.io). It does not have any posts as of now
