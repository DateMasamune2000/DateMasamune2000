# Description
I am a university student who likes machines.

# Current interests
- Data storage
- Developing on UNIX-like platforms (process management, signals, IPC, ...)
- Windows development and administration
- String operations (pattern matching, tokenization, parsing)
- x86 assembly language
- Computer architecture

# Setup
- Arch refugee currently running Debian 12 on an AMD64 system because frequent breaking updates are for losers. I'd be using Slackware if it supported UEFI better.
- `sway` with the `foot` terminal, both barely configured. Ricing is basically choosing a good wallpaper (which I have many of) and a good colorscheme (which I usually steal from elsewhere). `hyprland` and `wayfire` are not for me, as is `compiz`. Animations are unnecessary and eat resources.
- `bash` shell with `vi` keybinds and GNU coreutils
- `vim` (not `neovim`) and occasionally `emacs` (with `vi` keybinds) for anything that requires an IDE.

# Grass-touching setup
- Desk lamp to read books at night
- Bicycle to occasionally get out of the house so I don't become a shut-in

# Blog
- I have a [github.io blog](datemasamune2000.github.io). It is mostly shitposting but I do my best to make it informative and helpful in my tutorials.

# Before you ask
- No I will not buy your \<insert meme name here\>coin.
- Niether my Windows VM nor my Linux host has a virus. You are not Microsoft or whatever and you cannot fix my computer.
- There is no Nigerian prince (or even Nigerian) anywhere in my family tree (yes this is true). I inherit not a dollar of any of their fortunes.
- I-It's not like I like anime or anything, i-idiot!! (proceeds to look for black Les Paul Customs in the trash to load into the AE86 I don't have)
- No I don't get my tech advice from `/g/`. If I did I'd be using Rust.
