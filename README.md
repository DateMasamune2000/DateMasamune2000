# Description
I am a university student who likes machines.

# Current interests
- Data storage
- Developing on UNIX-like platforms (process management, signals, IPC, ...)
- Windows development and administration
- String operations (pattern matching, tokenization, parsing)
- x86 assembly language
- Computer architecture

# Setup
- Arch refugee currently running Debian 12 on an AMD64 system because frequent breaking updates are for losers. I'd be using Slackware if it supported UEFI better.
- `sway` with the `foot` terminal, both barely configured. Ricing is basically choosing a good wallpaper (which I have many of) and a good colorscheme (which I usually steal from elsewhere). `hyprland` and `wayfire` are not for me, as is `compiz`. Animations are unnecessary and eat resources.
- `bash` shell with `vi` keybinds and GNU coreutils
- `vim` (not `neovim`) and occasionally `emacs` (with `vi` keybinds) for anything that requires an IDE.

# Grass-touching setup
- Desk lamp to read books at night
- Bicycle to occasionally get out of the house so I don't become a shut-in

# Blog
- I have a [github.io blog](datemasamune2000.github.io). It is mostly shitposting but I do my best to make it informative and helpful in my tutorials.

# Before you ask
- I don't do trading. This includes both securities and cryptocurrency.
- Niether my Windows VM nor my Linux host has a virus.
- My only opinion on LLMs in general is that I don't use them in my work because I believe words should be deliberate and purposeful. I don't particularly hate them but I don't want to be forced to use one.
- I am neither knowledgeable of nor interested in current events in geopolitics, unless they directly impact me and my work.
